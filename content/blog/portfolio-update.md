description: Made updates to portfolio project to add blog.
---
Updated my portfolio project to include my blog, and also updated the ordering of the projects.  I finally also resolved the issue with the responsiveness of the carousel items so now it will display from 3 to 2 to 1 projects depending on viewport size.

I am thinking of converting the p-panels to p-cards so that i can have the image displayed while also having text for the descriptions.  I also need to add another tools prop to the IProject, in order to update the Built With line without having to worry about the prime ng icons.



After, or during, these changes, I should also work updating newsfeed project.  I need to add a header at the top and add links.  I should probably also update the search functionality.



Item after that should be a covid map react project.
