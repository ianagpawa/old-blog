description: Updated carousel to galleria.
---
I changed the carousel I was using from PrimeNg to their galleria component.  I think it looks better now, but I still need to add a few things.  I also need to do massive clean up, remove unused code and files.  I also have to add ts docs and add some interfaces; just tidy everything up.  When I do that, I also need to update the images.



Before that though, I would like to redo my blog.  So, sorry blog.
