title: Newsfeed Update
description: Updated newsfeed project with new header
---
Decided to update the header to the my newsfeed project.  Removed the search and section dropdown for now.  Replaced it with a menu and will have the search bar on the right along with the section dropdown.   If I am to add more news sources, I should probably have the dropdown as the news sources, but if I stick with just the New York Times api, I should have it as the sections.



Not sure if I like the layout so far, I'm thinking of turning it instead into a collage, where the images are visible only, and on click a modal popups to show the article title and description.  Second click would link to the article source.  



Just took a look at primeng and saw the galleria component.  I'm going to use that with the thumbnails, that'll be perfect.  It also gave me the idea to switch the carousel with the galleria navigator on my portfolio.  That should be quick and easy.
