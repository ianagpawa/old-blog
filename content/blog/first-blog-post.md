I decided I needed a new blog so here we are.  I think I'm going to make this an all-purpose blog rather than a focused one, like I had before with the ones focused on music or technology.  



This was created using React, Gatsby and Netlify.  I was aware of Netlify but didn't really know what it was, so its a pleasant surprise to be working with it and not have any issues.  Same with Gatsby.  I initially wanted to create this blog through github-pages, but this has been rather convenient so far, super easy since its essentially bootstrapped with very simple tweaks, like getting rid of the /blog and moving it to the landing page instead.  I still have to do further customization to the style and do loads of clean up on the code.  There doesn't seem to have been any linting done on the starter project, so that's driving me crazy.  That might take more time than it did for me to set this all up from initial commit to deployment.
